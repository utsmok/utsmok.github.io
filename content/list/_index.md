You can open the full list of tools in a few different ways. The database is hosted on [airtable.com](https://airtable.com), and you can copy and re-use the data as you wish. The dataset is also regularly backed up on my [Github](https://github.com/utsmok/informationtools). 

Links to open the tables/views are listed here. Below that, a number of pages containing embedded versions of the tables are listed.
