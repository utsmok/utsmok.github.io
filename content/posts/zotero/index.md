The reference manager I would personally recommend to everyone is [Zotero](www.zotero.org). It's free, open source, and highly customizable. In this post I'll give a basic overview on how to install and use zotero, including some links to add-ons you can use.

Storing and referencing the sources you use is something everyone will need to do at some point in their research. You can just download pdfs to your PC and write your citations manually of course, but there are a ton of options available that automate (parts) of this process. Lots of people will be familiar with [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) for instance, or maybe you prefer online services like [MyBib](https://www.mybib.com/) or [EasyBib](https://www.easybib.com/). You might even be writing entire BibTeX files by hand! 

Zotero will take make doing all tasks related to managing and citing your sources a lot easier; especially once you set it up to work the way you like.
