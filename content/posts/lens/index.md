When you're doing a structured literature search chances are you're using one of the main commercial scholarly search engines like [Scopus](www.scopus.com), ["Web of Science"](https://www.webofscience.com/), or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/). These tools are often expensive, and often not intuitive to use. Unfortunately, you didn't have much of a choice in the past.

Recently free and open alternatives have been catching up with these juggernauts. Not just databases like [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/) or [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/), but also structured search engines like [Semantic Scholar](www.semanticscholar.com) or the topic of this post: [The Lens](www.lens.org).
