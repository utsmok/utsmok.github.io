# About
Welcome to LibraeT, the site that will help you find the *tools* that will help you find the answers you seek. Initally designed to give an overview of scholarly databases and search engines, but grew to include subject like open source search tools based on citation networks, plugins for Zotero, packages for R, software for systematic reviews, and much more.

There are two main parts to this site: the main [list](@/list/_index.md) with tools, links, descriptions, etc; and a [blog](@/posts/_index.md) containing background information, guides, comparisons, etc. All articles and database entries are tagged and categorized, which can be used to quickly find what you need. 

LibraeT is a personal project by me, Samuel Mok. I'm an information specialist working for the library of the University of Twente. My personal list of useful tools kept growing and growing, and I needed a way to keep my notes and links in one page, and be able to share it with the people I support, which is why I made this site. 

The name *LibraeT* is a combination of the root libr- (for library), brea (scottish for hillside), and Raet (a big moraine in Scandanavia). Why? Mainly to because I liked the name librae but it's been used a lot already, so I added a T to make it unique.

The source code for this page can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/utsmok/utsmok.github.io). You can contact me through e-mail or linkedIn by hitting the corresponding icon.
