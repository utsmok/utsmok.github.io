# About
Welcome to LibraeT, where I will share the results of my research of the tools that will help researchers do their research. Initally designed to give an overview of scholarly databases and search engines, the contents of this site are rapidly expanding to subjects like open source search tools based on citation networks, plugins for Zotero, packages for R, software for systematic reviews, and much more.

There are two main parts to this site: a [list](@/list/_index.md) with links and descriptions of tools, websites, external guides, and more; and a [blog](@/posts/_index.md) containing background information, recommendations, guides written by me, comparisons, etc. All articles and database entries are tagged and categorized on this site *and* in the list, so you can quickly and easily find what you need.

# The author

LibraeT is a personal project by me, Samuel Mok. I'm an information specialist working for the [library of the University of Twente](utwente.nl/library). My personal list of useful tools kept growing and growing, and I needed a way to keep my notes and links in one page, and be able to share it with the people I support, which led to this site. And why not share it with the rest of the world? 

I'm a big fan of open source software and open access, and I'm happy to share my work & collaborate with others. If you find anything useful here, feel free to share it, preferably with direct links or citations to me and this site. If you find any errors or have suggestions for improvement, please let me know. You can find the source code for the site and submit pull requests on [Github](https://github.com/utsmok/utsmok.github.io), or directly contact me through e-mail or LinkedIn by hitting the corresponding icons above.
