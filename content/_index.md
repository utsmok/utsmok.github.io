Welcome to the **Information Tools** page: the site that will help you find the *tools* that will help you find you the *sources* you need. The scope of this list is quite broad, examples of entries are scholarly databases, open source search tools based on citation networks, plugins for Zotero, packages for R, software for systematic reviews, and more.

There are two main parts to this site: you can browse the list of useful tools (available with multiple layouts, groupings, filters, etc), or read the blog containing background information, guides, comparisons, and more. 


**About**

Everything on this page was made by me: Samuel Mok. I'm an information specialist working for the library of the University of Twente. This site is a personal project that grew out of keeping a list of bookmarks of useful tools and guides I found. This list kept growing and growing, massively outgrowing the capabilities of the initial systems I used to keep track of it all. I decided to make a page to collect this, mainly for my own use, but why not share it with the world as well?

The source code for this page can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/utsmok/utsmok.github.io). You can contact me through e-mail or linkedIn by hitting the corresponding icon.
